Gitmoji Guide for AI Assistants
Purpose

This guide helps AI assistants understand and use gitmoji convention when creating commits. Using emojis on commit messages provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit with only looking at the emojis used. Gitmoji use emojis to make commit messages more expressive and easier to understand at a glance.
Repository Convention

A commit message is composed using the following pieces:

    intention: The intention you want to express with the commit, using one Unicode emoji from the gitmoji list.
    message: A brief, natural-language explanation of the change in imperative mood.

Format

<intention> <imperative message>

[optional body]

Do not add Conventional Commit prefixes or scopes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, or `chore:`. Match the repository's existing history: after the emoji, begin directly with a capitalized action verb such as `Add`, `Fix`, `Refine`, `Move`, `Show`, `Guard`, `Bump`, or `Resolve`.

Usage Guidelines for AI
Selecting the correct emoji

    Identify the primary purpose of the commit
    Choose the most specific emoji that matches the change
    Use only one emoji per commit for clarity
    Prioritize by impact: Breaking changes (💥) > Features (✨) > Fixes (🐛) > Refactoring (♻️)

Examples

✨ Add user authentication system

Implement JWT-based authentication with login and registration endpoints.
Closes #123

🐛 Resolve null pointer exception in user service

Added null check before accessing user properties to prevent crashes.

📝 Update installation instructions

Added step-by-step guide for setting up the development environment.

⚡️ Optimize user query with indexing

Reduced query time from 500ms to 50ms by adding composite index.

💥 Update API response format to REST specification

All API endpoints now return data in a standardized envelope format.
Clients must update their response parsing logic.

Best Practices

    Be atomic: One emoji, one purpose, one commit
    Write clear subjects: Keep under 60 characters, imperative mood
    Use the body: Explain "why" not "what" for complex changes
    Reference issues: Include issue numbers when applicable
    Indicate breaking changes: Use 💥 :boom:.
